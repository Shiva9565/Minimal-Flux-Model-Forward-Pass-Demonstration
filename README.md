# Set Up the Julia Environment:

Run the following commands in a Colab cell to install Julia, IJulia, and set up the Julia kernel:
Code: !apt-get install julia && julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("IJulia"); using IJulia; IJulia.installkernel("Julia")'
Restart the runtime and switch to the Julia kernel by going to Runtime > Change runtime type and selecting Julia.

# Challenges and Assumptions:

-Challenges
1.)Setting up Julia in Colab required additional steps (e.g., installing Julia and IJulia).
2.)Preprocessing images in Julia required manual resizing and normalization, which is less straightforward compared to Python libraries like PyTorch.

-Assumptions
1.)The input images are in a common format (e.g., PNG or JPEG).
2.)The model is designed for grayscale images of size 28x28. If using RGB images, the input shape and preprocessing steps need to be adjusted.

# Approach:

1. Minimal Flux Model
A simple neural network model is built using Flux in Julia.
The model consists of:
a.)A convolutional layer (Conv) with 16 filters and a 3x3 kernel.
b.)A max-pooling layer (MaxPool) for downsampling.
c.)A dense layer (Dense) with 10 output units.
d.)A softmax activation for probabilistic outputs.

2. Image Preprocessing
a.)Images are resized to 28x28 pixels, converted to grayscale, and normalized to the range [0, 1].
b.)The preprocessed image is reshaped to match the model's input shape: (height, width, channels, batch_size).

3. Forward Pass
a.)The preprocessed image is passed through the model.
b.)The output is printed, representing the probabilities for each class.

4. Python Preprocessing
a.)Images are resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized using PyTorch's transforms module.
b.)Preprocessed images are saved and displayed for verification.


# Images:
1.)Input Images
Place your input images (e.g., Sample1.png, Sample2.png) in the working directory or upload them to Colab.

2.)Preprocessed Images
Preprocessed images are saved as preprocessed_Sample1.png and preprocessed_Sample2.png.
To generate preprocessed images, run the Python preprocessing script provided.

3.)Output Images
The preprocessed images are displayed using matplotlib for verification.


# How to run:
1. Julia Code
Run the Julia code in Colab to define the model and perform a forward pass.
Replace "example_image.png" with the path to your image.

2. Python Preprocessing (Optional)
Run the Python script to preprocess images and display them.


# Example Output:
1.)Model Output
Model output (probabilities): [0.1, 0.05, 0.15, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05]
2.)Preprocessed Images
The preprocessed images are displayed using matplotlib.
